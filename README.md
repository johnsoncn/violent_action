# violent_action
Uminho MotionLab P19 violent action machine learning algorithms

## objectives:

- object detection & tracking and human action recognition
- human action recognition:identify and estimate human behavior
- object detection/categorization/tracking: detect and classify items (e.g. knifes, hand-guns, or personal objects like a book, phone, bag)
- sensors: RGB sensors (5 MP, 20fps), near infrared (NIR) and thermal
- Violent action
- Human-Object Interaction (HOI)
